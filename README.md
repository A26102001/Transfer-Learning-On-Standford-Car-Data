# Transfer-Learning-On-Standford-Car-Data
Innovative transportation systems (ITS) are now
being implemented. The objective is to improve
the efficiency and safety of transportation
networks by developing and automating their
administration and operation. Numerous tests
and research projects have been carried out in
an effort to solve the difficulties associated with
detecting and identifying automobiles. The goal
of this research is to create a deep learning
system that can categorize different car brands
or models using transfer learning methods.
Comparing various methods to determine the
most effective approach. By utilizing the
convolutional neural nets, we attempt to
automate the process of making the makemodel detection. Utilizing the subset of Stanford
car datasets for object detection, which include
thousands of photos of different cars. Various
transfer learning techniques are applied to
produce precise predictions and classifications.
The performance of the algorithms will be
compared based on different learning rates and
parameters afterwards for the highest accuracy.
